 * initial capital and are allowed to invest only in a fixed number of projects.
 * Our goal is to choose projects that give us the maximum profit.
 * 
 * We can start an investment project only when we have the required capital.
 * Once a project is selected, we can assume that its profit has become our
 * capital.
